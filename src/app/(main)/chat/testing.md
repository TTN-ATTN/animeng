# Waifu Chatbot Integration Testing

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All components created and properly structured
- [x] Chat logic hook implemented
- [x] Response data defined
- [x] Placeholder image generation implemented
- [x] Components integrated into chat page
- [ ] Verify all imports resolve correctly
- [ ] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] Confirm chat functionality works as expected
- [ ] Ensure visual consistency with the rest of the application

## Testing Notes
- The chatbot has been implemented as a modular React component within the Next.js project
- Client-side placeholder image generation is used to avoid external image dependencies
- The chatbot is integrated into the existing (main)/chat route
- All components follow the project's styling conventions using Tailwind CSS
- The implementation leverages existing UI components like Button where appropriate

## Known Limitations
- Placeholder images are generated on the client side and may take a moment to appear
- The chatbot uses predefined responses rather than AI-generated ones
- For production use, real character images should replace the generated placeholders

## Next Steps
- Complete final testing in the actual Next.js runtime environment
- Verify that all components render correctly
- Test the chat functionality with various inputs
- Ensure the UI is responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Document any remaining issues or enhancement opportunities
